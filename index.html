					I'm <u>Nayan</u>, a <u>Digital Product Designer</u> who transforms complex challenges into elegant, user-centric solutions. Currently shaping the future of learning at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learn.wizdom" target="_blank">Wizdom</a> as their <u>Founding Designer</u>, where I blend strategy with creativity to build experiences that users love.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					My journey spans from reimagining book summary platforms to launching Web3 projects that hit <u>top 5 rankings within 24 hours</u>. I've led redesigns that don't just look beautiful – they drive results. Whether it's crafting high-impact landing pages or conceptualizing AI learning companions, I thrive on projects that push boundaries.
				</p>

				<p>
					Beyond the screen, I'm deeply involved in India's tech community. You'll find my design fingerprints on <a href="https://flutterconf.in/" target="_blank">Flutter Conf India's</a> brand identity, <a href="https://www.techacks.org/" target="_blank">Techacks 4.0's</a> digital presence, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tedxnuv/" target="_blank">TEDxNUV's</a> event experience. Each project is a testament to my belief that <u>great design can elevate any experience</u>.
				</p>

				<p>
					I work across the full spectrum of product design – from <u>user research</u> and <u>wireframing</u> to <u>high-fidelity prototypes</u> and developer handoff. My toolkit includes <u>Figma</u>, <u>Protopie</u>, and <u>After Effects</u>, but my real superpower is turning complex problems into intuitive solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					Based in India, I speak fluent <u>English, Hindi, and Gujarati</u>. Currently wrapping up my Computer Engineering degree while actively shaping products that matter.
